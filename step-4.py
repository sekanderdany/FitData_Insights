Here’s a breakdown of how dictionaries are used in this code:

1. Reading data from a file: The CSV data is loaded into a NumPy array data using the numpy.loadtxt function. The dtype=str parameter ensures that all data is read as strings.

2. Adding data to the dictionary:

  - A new empty dictionary data_dict is created to store the data.
  - A for loop is used to iterate over each row in the data array, starting from index 1 to skip the header row.
  - For each row, the person’s name is extracted from the first element (row[0]), and the steps taken are extracted as a NumPy array of integers from the remaining elements (row[1:]).
  - A key-value pair is added to the data_dict dictionary, where the key is the person’s name, and the value is the array of steps taken.

3. Printing the dictionary: Finally, the data_dict dictionary is printed to display the stored data.
